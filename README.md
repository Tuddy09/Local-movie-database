So many movies, so little time. To make sure you do not miss any good movies, you absolutely need a software application to help you manage your films and create watch lists. The application can be used in two modes: administrator and user. When the application is started, it will offer the option to choose the mode.

The application has two modes: Administrator mode and User mode.

In Administrator mode:

The application features a database containing movie entries.
Administrators can update the database by adding, deleting, or modifying movie information.
Each movie entry includes a title, genre, year of release, number of likes, and a trailer link.
Administrators can view all movies in the database.
In User mode:

Users can create a watch list of movies they want to watch.
Users can view movies from the database by genre, displaying one movie at a time.
The displayed information includes title, genre, year of release, number of likes, and a trailer.
Users can add movies to their watch list if they like the trailer.
If a user doesn't like the trailer, they can skip to the next movie.
Users can delete movies from their watch list after watching them, and optionally rate the movie (increasing the number of likes in the database).
Users can view their watch list.

* #### created using layered architecture principles, C++ classes and templates, having the option to save your current playlist as CSV, HTML or a normal textfile, and has 98% test coverage for all modules except for the UI & GUI.
